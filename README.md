## Networking
In this laboratory i learn about connections between client-servers; using TCP, UDP and Sockets and how we should use them.
### Working with URLS
### Exercise 1
In the firt exercise i create a program when i learn about the URL and your componets , in the out of this exercise i get the results present below :
`protocol = http
authority = url.com:80
host = url.com
port = 80
path = /tutorial/index.html
query = name=URL
filename = /tutorial/index.html?name=URL
ref = PRUEBA`
### Exercise 2
In this exercise i create a program that copy the html from a web page and i put this code in a file.html and them i open this file with any browser, then i can see the pages who had copy.
